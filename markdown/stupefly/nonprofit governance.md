- Executive Committee notes
    - Legit Purposes
        - CEO review and compensation negotiation
        - Act on repetitive and routine financial and legal matters outside of regular board meetings (ideally where the full board has specifically authorized)
    - Recent trends that reduce need:
        - Electronic meetings
        - Emergence of Governance Committees
    - What is shouldn't be:
        - Mini board within a board
        - Constituted by titles (e.g., officers)
    - Arguments in favor
        - Quick response to emergencies (Emergencies should be handled by full board; Electronic comms)
        - Confidentiality (Nothing is confidential to subset of the board; Governance is legal and moral authority of the full board)
        - Set agenda for / steer board (Delegate to chair and CEO)
        - "Think tank" for CEO / "Best of breed" (But CEO can always convene a think tank of the members best suited)
    - Arguments against:
        - Originate from old-style, top-down corporate model of command and control
        - Power derived from privilege
        - Disempowering for non-members
        - Erodes transparency (and trust) 
    - Options
        - Test by suspending committee for 18-24 months
