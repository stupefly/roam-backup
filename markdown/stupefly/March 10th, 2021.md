Keep knowledge in your business by documenting your processes
If your organisation’s processes are not documented, you are taking an unnecessary risk. Think about it. What would happen if:

	•	The quality of your products/services is affected because staff are not following a consistent workflow?
Any of these situations could prove costly, especially if specialist knowledge was lost due to staff leaving. Yes, you can get a replacement in, but how long will it take and what will happen in the meantime? Why take the risk, when you can hire me as a process technical writer?

The end result is a manual or web content that gives clear in...
