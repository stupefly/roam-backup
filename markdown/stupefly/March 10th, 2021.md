Keep knowledge in your business by documenting your processes
If your organisation’s processes are not documented, you are taking an unnecessary risk. Think about it. What would happen if:
	•	Key members of your staff leave or are unable to work, with no notice?
	•	You unexpectedly need to recreate your business, or part of your business, in another location?
	•	The quality of your products/services is affected because staff are not following a consistent workflow?
Any of these situations could prove costly, especially if specialist knowledge was lost due to staff leaving. Yes, you can get a replacement in, but how long will it take and what will happen in the meantime? Why take the risk, when you can hire me as a process technical writer?
As your process technical writer, I will document your business processes, including design, assembly, installation, and health and safety. To do this, I will need to shadow your staff, so that I can see what they do, ask about what would happen in different circumstances, and create a record of the correct way of doing things. 
The end result is a manual or web content that gives clear in...
