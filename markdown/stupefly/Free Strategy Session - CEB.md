- Dear Bill,

I dropped the ball…

And that’s why I’m getting in touch.

After reviewing our records over the past year, I noticed an interesting trend. 

The CPA’s who have taken our practice growth program are reporting amazing results despite the pandemic and economic lock-downs. For example:

Jessica Gonifas, CPA told us, “Within 30 hours a week, I think I can be closer to the $400,000 mark a year. So, almost doubling the revenue. Which is pretty amazing to think about.” 

Tressa Heath, CPA turned two conversations into $6,500/mo. She said, “This is vital and amazing for your practice and life.” 

Bridgett Gagne, CPA raved, “I will 5X my revenue in the next year.” 

They’re not the only ones. Dozens of firm owners from across the country are transforming their  practices by applying our system. 

Due to the personalized nature of our program, we’ve been focused on helping these firm owners exclusively to take their practices to a new level of success. 

Which means, until now, we haven’t had time to get back in touch and see if you’re ready to…

•        Increase your realization rates.
•        Boost your firm’s bottom line.
•        Attract high-profit clients.
•        Earn more while working less.
•        And finally, be in control. 

Look, the firm owners we’re helping are just like you. They were skeptical at first. But they had enough of the grind, working way too hard for way too little, not seeing a way out and desperately wanting a solution. 

But… they took that first step and now they’re enjoying the kind of practice they always wanted. 

You can too!

The first step is to get on the phone, discuss your current situation, and show you how to start attracting high-profit engagements in the next few weeks without the usual stress and struggle - yes even during tax season and yes in this economy... 

There’s no charge for this meeting, but it could be the springboard to a whole new experience for you as a firm owner. 

Obviously, this isn’t for everyone. 

The firm owners who get the most from these one-on-one calls want to grow their firm in a systematic way without over-working. 

They want to finally make real money while providing the highest level of service possible. 

They want to make a real change in their clients’ lives without sacrificing their own. 

If that sounds like you, then I urge you to…
