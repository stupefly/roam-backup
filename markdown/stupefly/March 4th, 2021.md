- #CIIS meeting re: search on [[March 5th, 2021]]
    - Issues: 
        - Unresolved conflict re: Aneel candidacy 
        - Corresponding lack of confidence is search committee
        - Serious enough to precipitate resignations if not resolved
    - Path to resolution:
        - Convene a board meeting to:
            - consider Aneel's status as a future candidate
            - affirm its path forward after resolving primary question
