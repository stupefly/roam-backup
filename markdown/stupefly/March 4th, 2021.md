    - #CIIS meeting re: search[[March 5th, 2021]]
- Issues: 
	- Unresolved conflict re: Aneel candidacy 
	- Corresponding lack of confidence is search committee
	- Serious enough to precipitate resignations if not resolved
- Path to resolution:
	- Convene a board meeting to:
		- consider Aneel's status as a future candidate
		- affirm its path forward after resolving primary question
