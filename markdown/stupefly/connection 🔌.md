- #[[Jonathan Weisblatt]] - Notes on the rupture
    - Fragility is pathetic 
    - All feelings are valid vs "boo hoo"
    - I couldnâ€™t give fucks about someone making snarky commment in a complex moment. Boo hoo. But I apologize even though I believe it was nothing wrong
    - Trolling was my *perception*, not "projection"
    - Just because it makes you feel bad or hurts you doesn't make it abuse. Abuse : deliberately damage anothers personâ€™s feelings of self-worth and independence. Characterized by a pattern of aggressing, denying, and minimizing. Rooted in power and control. Isolated incidents of verbal aggression, dominant conduct or jealous behaviors does not constitute abuse as they are not sustained and repetitive. It is a course of conduct, not an event. 
    - Freedom from social convention   self-righteous anger   shirked responsibility = the core of trumpism; individual rights trump social obligation 
    - Facebook shoveling coal into the furnace of totalitarianism 
    - You can't apologize for someone's feelings, only for your own behavior and actions. "I apologize that I hurt your feelings" focuses on the other's feelings as the issue, not your actions. The subtext: you believe the other person is unreasonable for feeling how they do, and that it isnâ€™t your fault/problem.
